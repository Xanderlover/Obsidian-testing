## Making the Tempo Match the Game (Music)

Depending on the setting of what we are currently doing, the music should follow alongside it smoothly. The right tempo will vary depending on the speed of the action. Different scenes or stages will call and rely on different types of certain tempos or rhythms.

BPM stands for beats-per-minute.

- If we are idling/fishing, then it should be a BPM, relaxing.
- If we are being chased by some monster creature. then the beat is set to a higher tempo

For fighting games the stage music that's been arranged suitable for battle, is generally a little over 120 BPM. But also around the range of 130-170 BPM on average. And sometimes around the range of 200 BPM, those are exceptions not rules.

Sometimes transforming simple ideas that are low in tempo to higher ones as the actions that depend on it, can make things more interseting?/ todo

## Strike a Balance with Sound Effects

Sound priority can be challenging to figure out, which sound effect should stand out more. But it can be simplified by using a method, where if the action is more relevant to the player, the louder it is. (vice-versa)

**Relevance to the player:**
(The more)
**Relevant** sound to the player, the **higher (louder)** the **sound volume** should be.
**Irrelevant** sound is to the player, the **lower (softer)** the **sound volume** should be.

**Priority of sounds that are most relevant/loud to least relevant/soft.**
1. KO - Loudest
2. Impacts
3. Special Moves
4. Voice/Exclaim
5. Booms
	1. This falls between Special Moves and Voice/Exclaim
6. Dodges
7. Attack Swings
8. Jumping & Landing
9. Walking - Softest
	1. Footsteps can be a pain sometimes as you have to keep in mind different floor surface textures produce different sounds

Now these may vary depending on the genre of the gaming. a horror game might have louder walking sounds.

Make sure to see which is more relevant to the player and the character and prioritize accordingly

## Listen in Various Environments

Sound quality will differ depending on your environment.

TV speakers tend to be smaller with lower-frequency, tones can often get lost.
resulting in less impactful sounds.

It is important to setup a sound environment with good sound proofing, and high quality speakers, and microphones.

Also to keep in mind different headphones produce slightly different results, so maintaining sound quality among them might give a difficult challenge.

But if you take sound tuning too far, it might stray away from your creative vision.
So focus on finding a good balance on different speakers, or multiple environments.
But it is recommended to use studio speakers to finalize sounds.

## Game Music and Ambient Sounds

## Audio as Fiction and Non-Fiction

Fighting games have unrealistic sounds
But for some reason Minecraft has realistic sounds despite the pixelated graphics

## Arranging Music

Arranging songs can be multitude of different ways, and that of course depends on how your game will play out.

Depending on the game the arrangement goes something like.

**Smash Bros Ultimate: Intro > Main Theme > Deviation > Back to Main (LOOP)**

**Celeste (Resurrections track): Intro > (Part 1) Idea 2 > Idea 3 > (Part 2) Idea 1 > (Part 2) Idea 2 > Deviation > (Part 3) Chorus 1 > Chorus 2?**
**TODO**

Sometimes composers might get attached on a certain arrangement or musical piece, but it is something you can make similar but not replicate?

Also humming them melody is vital to having a good memorable music song.

This will delve deeper and explain the process of making sounds, and music.

## The Original Piece is Always Right

Sometimes the countermelody from an **(NES)** game might sound like the main melody.

Psycho Solider 1987 theme, had 3 verses in the original (Japanese), but 1 verse in the original (English).
In Smash Bros Ultimate they recreated the Japanese version, but for the English one they did, **Verse 1 > Instrumental (tenor sax) > Verse 1**, similar to the original but amplifying the style.

Also the translation of lyrics but keeping the same melody, gives the "Japanized English", or ”日本語英語”. Where pronunciation of English syllables are bit off, or more distinct.

When arranging an old piece, keep the nostalgia people have with it.

## Strong Attack Light Reverb
*(Attack as in amplitude graph)*

![[audio_waveform.png]]
<center><i>Image from J-09 Audio Category Compilation</i></center>

When making an attack sound for a game ensure the sound is "strong" or loud in the beginning to ensure that it immediately has an impact.

Impact sounds should never feel it's coming too late.

>But in order for it to sound right it can't simply start at peak volume, But it's important that we get a strong/loud sound almost immediately.

Next is reverb

>Sounds that echo do feel more impactful, but if other sounds play while the previous is still playing, they'll get lost in the mix.

for things like **Hit Stop**

The sound effect should play while time is frozen, and ideally the main part of the sound effect should be over, before the action/Hit Stop resumes.
## Giving Feedback for Sound Effect

Doing that can be challenging for sounds, since it doesn't have a physical form. So you use words to describe the texture of the sounds, or might use references from other media content to give feedback. (You also can't approximate with your voice.)

You can use technical terms like stronger attack, or slowly fade away the reverb as the effect tails of.

![[audio_waveform.png]]
<center><i>Image from J-09 Audio Category Compilation</i></center>

You might use words like "*can you make it sound like a jet engine?*", but not everyone knows what a jet engine sounds like. Or *"something like really high pitched and squeaky?"*.

For referencing sounds you can use online media videos, and try not to use onomatopoeia very much. But contradicting that sometimes onomatopoeia can be helpful.

But at the end of the day, it's okay to not get the exact sounds that you imagined. But as long as they fit the game, Life Goes On. 
*(Also making sound effects can be an iterative process, so it's okay if you fail and redo them)*

## Balancing Ambient Sounds

Using previous knowledge of sound priority, **ambient sounds** could be the least relevant to the listener.

Also keep in mind that speakers might also shift the tone.

Additionally if you stand still and stop playing for a second, having to hear nothing but absolute dead silence, might break immersion, or the atmosphere.

Sound can really immerse someone into the video game world, but opposed to other effects that need to stand out Ambient Sound is a filler.

Even in cartoony games, like Hollow Knight... Silksong, can have realistic ambient sounds, like the wind blowing in Dirtmouth.

## Using Other Songs for Audio Reference

When making a game you're making a game, you'll think of a piece of music that's a perfect fit. One that already exists. And in some cases you would ask your composer to make something just like it.

As a reference point that would be great, if you want ideas where to start, giving a concrete example.

But the danger in doing so is that you (director/composer) might get too fixated and closing your mind to other opportunities.

And everything will sound like cheap imitationーand you can't lock yourself like that.

And when creating the music, you might have a hard time trying to make something similar, yet somehow with your own unique different twist.

>But.. what parts are you supposed to change?ーWhich is a common way to lose sight of goals.

A decent way to get over this obstacle, is to create the genre in a different style (changing instruments, different tempo, etc.). While still capturing the emotion conveyed.

Reminder you can negotiate for music licensing with the rightsholders. But that isn't always an option for smaller studios.

Using references applies to much more than just music.

## Famiocom and NES Audio (Synths)

Famicom (old computer from Nintendo) contained audio processing of 5 channels

- **Pulse**
- *Pulse (again)*
- **Triangle**
- **Noise**
- **DPCM**

![[FamicomAudioProcessing.png]]

Long sine wavelengths = Low pitches, that will be produced.
Short sine wavelengths = High Pitches.

**Sine waves**, have a nice smooth quality to them.

**Square shaped waves**, can also be called "pulse wave." has a sharp sound (Used as melody)

**Triangle wave** has a mellow/muffled quality (Commonly used as base line)

**Noise** is commonly used as percussion for music. but less used compared to effects, such as hit noises, booms, cheers, or waves. it sounds like "tshhh"!

**DPCM** is used for sampling real life sounds, such as percussion for Super Mario Bros. 3, or vocals. Sampling wasn't clean and sounded "bitcrushed/bitcrunched" which has it's own artistic artstyle.

And the hardware kept getting better, providing "Wave Memory" which is a sustained note. And a chip build into the cartridge expanding the audio range, and quailty even further.

And when selling NES overseas versions. lacked extend audio range. Giving the music different quality.

Also listen to these tracks from ![Silver Surfer](https://youtu.be/sSF1e1nKNFE?list=PLgKCjZ2WsVLRTyQdpuEsCm0Lde5bO2WUv&t=1377) is gud? why?

## No Masterpiece Has Bad Audio

>If you'll excuse the opinion... Actually, everything on this documents is my opinion, so it should be okay! :3

Experiencing plenty of games, none of them have bad audio. The more games you play, the more convincing this statement is.

Long time ago games had no audio whatsoever. (Rogue)

But later, titles with nothing more than simple noise-based sound effects had well-constructed audio! (Breakout, Space Invaders, Galaxian)

Some games are masterpieces although having bad **graphics**, or lacking coherent **game essence**.

When remembering a game, one of the first things that make actions memorable, can be audio. Objection?! I see none. So it is certainly something not to take lightly!

Naturally audio includes both **music** and **sound effects**. Hence, impossible to make them bad I win bye-bye!

Except for this ![game](https://youtu.be/aWxni7NiQ6M?t=738).

*(mobile games might be an exception since you might play with the volume really low)*
