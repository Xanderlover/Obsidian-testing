## Making the Tempo Match the Game (Music)

Depending on the setting of what we are currently doing, the music should follow alongside it smoothly. The right tempo will vary depending on the speed of the action. Different scenes or stages will call and rely on different types of certain tempos or rhythms.

BPM stands for beats-per-minute.

- If we are idling/fishing, then it should be a BPM, relaxing.
- If we are being chased by some monster creature. then the beat is set to a higher tempo

For fighting games the stage music that's been arranged suitable for battle, is generally a little over 120 BPM. But also around the range of 130-170 BPM on average. And sometimes around the range of 200 BPM, those are exceptions not rules.

Sometimes transforming simple ideas that are low in tempo to higher ones as the actions that depend on it, can make things more interseting?/ todo

## Strike a Balance with Sound Effects

Sound priority can be challenging to figure out, which sound effect should stand out more. But it can be simplified by using a method, where if the action is more relevant to the player, the louder it is. (vice-versa)

**Relevance to the player:**
(The more)
**Relevant** sound to the player, the **higher (louder)** the **sound volume** should be.
**Irrelevant** sound is to the player, the **lower (softer)** the **sound volume** should be.

**Priority of sounds that are most relevant/loud to least relevant/soft.**
1. KO - Loudest
2. Impacts
3. Special Moves
4. Voice/Exclaim
5. Booms
	1. This falls between Special Moves and Voice/Exclaim
6. Dodges
7. Attack Swings
8. Jumping & Landing
9. Walking - Softest
	1. Footsteps can be a pain sometimes as you have to keep in mind different floor surface textures produce different sounds

Now these may vary depending on the genre of the gaming. a horror game might have louder walking sounds.

Make sure to see which is more relevant to the player and the character and prioritize accordingly

## Listen in Various Environments

Sound quality will differ depending on your environment.

TV speakers tend to be smaller with lower-frequency, tones can often get lost.
resulting in less impactful sounds.

It is important to setup a sound environment with good sound proofing, and high quality speakers, and microphones.

Also to keep in mind different headphones produce slightly different results, so maintaining sound quality among them might give a difficult challenge.

But if you take sound tuning too far, it might stray away from your creative vision.
So focus on finding a good balance on different speakers, or multiple environments.
But it is recommended to use studio speakers to finalize sounds.

## Audio as Fiction and Non-Fiction

Fighting games have unrealistic sounds
But for some reason Minecraft has realistic sounds despite the pixelated graphics

## Arranging Music

Arranging songs can be multitude of different ways, and that of course depends on how your game will play out.

Depending on the game the arrangement goes something like.

**Smash Bros Ultimate: Intro > Main Theme > Deviation > Back to Main (LOOP)**

**Celeste (Resurrections track): Intro > (Part 1) Idea 2 > Idea 3 > (Part 2) Idea 1 > (Part 2) Idea 2 > Deviation > (Part 3) Chorus 1 > Chorus 2?**
**TODO**

Sometimes composers might get attached on a certain arrangement or musical piece, but it is something you can make similar but not replicate?

Also humming them melody is vital to having a good memorable music song.
