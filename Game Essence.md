As a video game has *more* **essence**, the *less* broad **appeal** it will have!

Game Essence category will go and describe what makes a video game fun! Or appealing. :O Or how can we innovate on already existing features? Do we need certain features? What if there are certain bugs, can they be features too?

This category is closely related to [[Planning & Game Design]]

**Tags:** #Game

## **RISK AND REWARD**

Can be described as the **risk** it takes to do something that can be **rewarding**.

## **Squeeze and Release** *(Stress & Relief)*

Can be described as fighting a really tough boss (in Dark Souls presumably) that has a really fast **risky** combo and is difficult to dodge, but once you dodge it. They sort of have some time to recover and your chance to attack! Or claim the **Reward**, or attacking.

Can also describe defeating a really difficult fight against any opponent.

## **Game Essence in Role-Playing Games**

Can come in many forms, as winning battles gives you rewards and experience.
or guessing which element someone is strong to, or weak against can give "Player Experience".

And there might a factor of *exploration*, as you continue throughout the game, whether through moving into different areas, or getting into battles with different opponents.

Or finding new friends that will help you, and follow you along throughout the entire journey.

Of course no one is bound to these rules, and anyone can break them to innovate on them. :D

**Fun Beyond Game Essence**
Different genres of video games have different elements that make them fun.

1. **Games that are fun to control**
	1. These can be platformers or racing games as a good example.
2. **Adventure/Visual Novels/Cinematic Story**
	1. As the story unfolds, you're left wondering what happens next. :O :D (but that's not compelling enough) WIP
3. *Horror Games*
	1. The horror genre can be vast?! But there is a problem when trying to find a good balance between **Game Essence** and **Appeal**.
4. And more **To Be Done....** @experimental

## **THE FIEndS CAULDRON!!**

	The more intensity the higher the reward?

The more intensity and risk the player desires, the higher the reward they receive. This can be done by adjusting difficulty, or placing my hearts into the cauldorn.

## **Let Players Che(ese)at the System**

> "It's not a bug it's a feature" — Todd Howard

Allow players to **min-max** their gains in a game.

For example: It can involve taking a **larger losses** for even **greater gain**

This can apply to majority of genres like:
* Action games,
* First person games,
* Fighting games,
* Role-playing games,
* Puzzle games.
* Gambling games.

Just about any game with **Push and Pull** or **Risk and Reward**, will involve some kind of strategy.

Allowing players to break the system can not only be fun, but also memorable.

>"It just works" — also Todd Howard

# Game Essence Part 2

Delving deeper into game essence, and what was explained before. In a more game environment.
## Opposing Mechanics

The opposite mechanics in video games can add variety of fun.
in games where you have to move in high speeds, it conditions players to slow down.
TBD

**When adding a mechanic to your game. think about how to oppose that mechanic, too.** This is like the opposite side of the **Risk and Reward** coin.

## Do We Really Need Enemies? (Base of a game)

Enemies can be a way to push the player away from their goal or finish line. But can also provide plenty of **Stress and Relief, and Push and Pull, or Risk and Reward**!

Obstacle that applies **stress**. Next the obstacle is gotten over, which provides **relief**.

Then partaking in that **risk**. You're **rewarded** with an item. or experience, to help you get *stronger*. That's **growth**.

Growth can make you excited for what comes next, and gives you a high sense of satisfaction. *(imagine beating the final boss in a video game)*

As a result, the next obstacle becomes easier to move. And the cycle repeats. That's is called **progress**. Allowing you to advance further into the game.

1. Stress
2. Relief
3. Growth
4. Progress

Besides initial **stress** the latter three *(relief, growth, progress)* are what makes a game actually fun. But it's difficult to establish them without that initial stress.

**Stress and Relief:** Can be having to buy something.
**Growth and Progress:** Something expensive to buy?! save up and look forward to to it!

You can take out the enemies from the game, but you still need to provide the features of stress and relief
when designing your game try to also include elements of growth and progress whenever possible.

But what makes an enemy fun to oppose,
Rivalry System?!

*Stress -> Relief -> Growth -> Progress -> fills you with **DETERMINATION***

## Consider Rewards First

Especially in games about **defeating enemies!**
It's **essential** to provide **reward**, when defeating foes, or completing missions.

Old games used to **reward** players with *scores*. But that's not enough, so we **reward** with **Level Ups, Skill Points, Power-Ups, Money, Experience, Player Experience, Items, DETERMINATION.**

**Progression** in itself could be a reward, without having the above. But that isn't really motivating for modern games.

>More than anything, rewards are the source of a player's investment in a game. ー Sakurai!

Now this can depends on the **genre**, but once you have the **bones** of your game, you can **start thinking about rewards.**

**Earn Rewards = Spend Rewards** (Luigi's Mansion 2, or Cookie Clicker)
**Earn Materials = Craft Materials** (Minecraft, Kingdom Hearts II)

It's vital the player feels like they're profiting and the end product is a must-have.

And not having to spend the **rewards** might feel ***daunting and meaningless***, So having **Opposing mechanics** helps a lot.

**But rewards can also be collectibles**, such as playable characters, or equipment you can use. (Terraria, Animal Crossing)

**Rewards are engaging** and keep in mind to implement them first.
Delving deeper into the essence of a subjective game.

# Game Essence Part 3

## Game Essence in Shooting Games

Strong game essence isn't everything, do whatever feels right

If you want to make a game with it's own unique flavor, don't just mimic an existing game. Instead think about why that game is fun in the first place

## More Game Essence Means Less Broad Appeal

Thinking about game essence and **risk and reward** can help make your game more fun!
But keep in mind...
**game essence** can reduce your game's **broad appeal**

Think of a comparison between **Dark Souls**, and **Kirby Dream Land**

While prioritizing more game mechanics *(Push and Pull, Stress Relief, Risk Reward)*, overcomplicated rulesets can make the experience difficult to grasp.

Sometimes, it's important to **hold back from boosting game essence**. But that **depends on your game.**

This can also happen to adjusting parameters, making Kirby inhale range shorter, or changing jump inertia, or making Kirby have 1 live.

Will boost game essence. However it will decrease broad appeal

Risk & Return should be balanced in perfect proportions.
More intense risk, produce more intense joy when you overcome it!
Low risk should bring low reward.

>This means low risk of the beginner-focused games (Kirby), also leads to the downside of making the game less fun. But of course that doesn't mean that it doesn't work as a game.

**Different people perceive difficulty in different ways!**

What feels like something low risk to an experienced player, might seem like a brick wall to someone less experienced.

It's' all really subjective.

Be aware of your target audience, who you're targeting should depend on your game design's and concept.

## Making "Work" Games Fun

# Game Essence Part 4

## Amplify Both Strengths and Weaknesses

We will be talking about balancing a game.

As an Example
When Smash Bros Ultimate was being playtested, they used both workers, and online data.

If a fighter was too **strong**, they'd often **peak down the strength**,
while **compensating by lessening the weakness**.
![[balancing parameters.png]]

But the more similar you make the abilities, the more they will start to feel like the same. **THAT'S NOT FUN!**

It is unlike choosing the same character,
making fighters similar. **The Game Loses its Individuality**

Having individuality can make opinions where players have certain characterse that are better and favorable.
Due to social media and echo chambers biases spread quickly and,

**People Seek "Answers" Instead of Trying It Themselves**

Variety of fighters is what makes the game fresh! You want a dynamic range as far as you possibly can.

**Character Diversity is a Game's Lifeblood!**

Even if one single attack has plenty of different components. It's nott just attack power, it can be:

- **Attack speed**
- **Knockback**
- **Duration**
- **Length of the follow-through**
- **Attack range**
- **Hit Size**
- **Animation speed**
- **Ability to combo**
- **Shield damage**
- **Shield recovery**
- **and so on!**

You could leave a moves characteristic attack power untouched, but change the follow-throughーa time when the fighter is vulnerable. Or make the hit box smaller.

Configuring these stats, have nearly infinite possibilities

But this doesn't apply only to fighters, it can apply to items that change the game! Make them as diverse as possible.

This can apply to magnitude of other genres without competitive elements.
Also consider [[Planning & Game Design#Using Parameters to Establish Characters]] **Using Parameters to Establish Characters** to make things stand out:

![[Make Characters Stand Out.png]]

- Invincible!
- Boomerang!
- Rapid Fire!

Lots of actions and moves, don't make the balance mediocre! Keep your peaks and valleys.

## Give Yourself a Handicap. When Balancing Your Game

Game balance is something dev teams often spend time on.

When it comes to difficult (souls-like) games where you're meant to die repeatedly, they're not actually too tough to balance.

Members of dev team are naturally familiar with their game, so things will be perfect if they're just barely able to squeak by.

The game will be proven to be beatable, by those who know it inside and outーmeaning it will pose a real challenge

Of course some people will have their skills exceed, some won't.

The more you tune the game for skilled players, the harder it will be. (sky is blue)

But if you **tune and balance based on the best player**, the **game might be too difficult** for players who buy it, **and that isn't fun (maybe even boring).**

Even if you balance the game by taking the median, average-skilled member.
It'll still be difficult

Naturally ask someone who is unfamiliar with the game to come and play. But sometimes they won't have time to finish it.
And they will grow familiar if you keep inviting them.


**TO OVERcomE THIS**
It's best to lower the difficulty tend to do it by giving yourself some sort of handicap with the controls

- **Playing one-handed** *(Life handicap)*
- **Start with 50% health** *(Tangible limitations)*
- **Start with one life** *(Stricter Conditions)*

Players will always differ in skill level, so there is no right answer.
And balancing the game to have no risk, might make it boring.
because there's certainly joy in persevering through difficult challenges, aswell.

Consider adding:

- Accessibility
- Assist mode

**Most players won't be used to playing your game yet!**

>But developers who already know a game shouldn't be considered as the standardーinstead, make the game even easier than you think it should be, and it'll be just right. :3


# Additional Notes:

**Dark Souls III** does a really good job of **R&R** and **S&R** — You can also Cheese to gain souls.

I would say the most important things to prioritize when making a game are

Risk & Reward + Stress & Relief

1. Stress
2. Relief
3. Growth
4. Progress

Consider planning ahead the rewards after defining the foundation of a genre.
Opposing mechanics so you have meaning for your rewards.

## Addiitional thingh (PUSh and pull?!) TODO

**Push & Pull**

example can be **obstacles push you back to fail**, **actions move you forward to succeed**!
